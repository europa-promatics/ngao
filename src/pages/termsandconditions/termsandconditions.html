Such information is intrinsically fluctuant and may be inaccurate, incomplete or outdated. We do not provide any warranties to such Content's credibility or reliability. So while we hope to get you to your destination, please be safe when using the Application and don’t blame us if you get lost.
</p>


<p>
(a)We may use your route information to create a route history, which we use to offer the Service to you, to improve the quality of the Service we offer to you and to all of our Users and to improve the accuracy of our mapping and navigation data.  This history is associated with your account and username if you have chosen to set up a username or a unique identifier generated by us if you have not, in each case in accordance with the Privacy Policy. We may also allow you to store your favorite locations if you have an Account (defined below).
</p>

<p>
(b)Third party advertisements may appear on the Services from time to time. We do not endorse these advertisements and all such advertisements are subject to Section 9.  
</p>
<p>
(c)Transmitting and receiving real-time updates to and from the Services, requires an online (e.g. Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G) connection between your cellular device and the Internet. The expenses of such connection are as prescribed by the agreement between you and your communication service provider (such as your cellular company), and according to its applicable terms of payment.

<p>

Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Ngao’s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Ngao Properties.  You have the ability to disable the connection between your Account and your Third-Party Accounts at any time by accessing the “Settings” section of the Application.  PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND NGAO DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS.  Ngao makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality or noninfringement, and Ngao is not responsible for any SNS Content.

</p>
<p>

<p>
	1.3.No Subsequent Registration.  If your registration(s) with or ability to access the Ngao Properties, or any other Ngao community is discontinued by Ngao due to your violation of any portion of the Terms or for conduct otherwise inappropriate for the community, then you agree that you shall not attempt to re-register with or access the Ngao Properties or any Ngao community through use of a different member name or otherwise, and you acknowledge that you will not be entitled to receive a refund for fees related to those Ngao Properties to which your access has been terminated.  In the event that you violate the immediately preceding sentence, Ngao reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately take any or all of the actions set forth herein without any notice or warning to you.

<p>

1.7. Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver; Waiver of Trial by Jury.  Please read this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It is part of your contract with Ngao and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
</p>

<p>
(a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by Ngao that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Ngao, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
</p>


<p>
(b)Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.  Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to Ngao should be sent to: Ngao, Inc., 222 Broadway, 19th Floor, NY, NY 10038.  After the Notice is received, you and Ngao may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and Ngao do not resolve the claim or dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled. 

</p>

<p>
(c)Arbitration Rules.  Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a location within one hundred (100) miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
	(d)Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.

</p>
<p>
	(e)Authority of Arbitrator.  If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Ngao, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Ngao. 
</p>
<p>
(f)Waiver of Jury Trial.  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.  In the event any litigation should arise between you and Ngao in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND NGAO WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

</p>
<p>

(g)Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
</p>
<p>
(h)Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.	
</p>
<p>
(i)Right to Waive.  Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived 	
</p>
<p>
(i) Right to Waive.  Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or effect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.	
</p>
<p>

(j) Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Ngao.

</p>
<p>

(k)Small Claims Court.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Ngao may bring an individual action in small claims court.	
</p>
<p>
	(l) Emergency Equitable Relief.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
</p>
<p>
(m)Courts.  In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in New York, for such purpose. 
	
</p>
<p>
1.8.Governing Law.  The Terms and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of the State of New York, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms.
</p>
<p>
1.9.Choice of Language.  It is the express wish of the parties that the Terms and all related documents have been drawn up in English.  C’est law volone expresse des parties que la presente convention ainsi que les documents qui s’y rattacent soient rediges en anglais.
</p>
<p>
	1.10. Notice.  Where Ngao requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing Ngao with your most current e-mail address.  In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Ngao is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by the Terms, Ngao’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice.  You may give notice to Ngao at the following address: info@ngaosecurity.com. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by Ngao by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.

</p>
<p>
	1.11. Waiver.  Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.

</p>
<p>
	
1.12.Severability.  If any provision of the Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.
</p>
<p>
1.13.      Export Control.  You may not use, export, import, or transfer the Ngao Properties except as authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the Ngao Properties, and any other applicable laws.  In particular, but without limitation, the Ngao Properties may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any United States embargoed countries, or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Person’s List or Entity List. By using the Ngao Properties, you represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You also will not use the Ngao Properties for any purpose prohibited by U.S. law, including the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.  You acknowledge and agree that products, services or technology provided by Ngao are subject to the export control laws and regulations of the United States.  You shall comply with these laws and regulations and shall not, without prior U.S. government authorization, export, re-export, or transfer Ngao products, services or technology, either directly or indirectly, to any country in violation of such laws and regulations.

These references do not imply that Ngao intends to announce such Services or Content in your country.  The Ngao Properties are controlled and offered by Ngao from its facilities in the United States of America. Ngao makes no representations that the Ngao Properties are appropriate or available for use in other locations.  Those who access or use the Ngao Properties from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.1.14.      Consumer Complaints. In accordance with California Civil Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.
</p>
<p>
	1.15. Entire Agreement.  The Terms are the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the parties with respect to such subject matter.

</p>

<p>
	
18.  International Provisions. The Ngao Properties can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain references to Services and Content that are not available in your country.  
</p>
<p>1.2.United Kingdom.  A third party who is not a party to the Terms has no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any provision of the Terms, but this does not affect any right or remedy of such third party which exists or is available apart from that Act.</p>
<p>1.3. Germany.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 13, Ngao is also not liable for acts of simple negligence (unless they cause injuries to or death of any person), except when they are caused by a breach of any substantial contractual obligations (vertragswesentliche Pflichten).</p>
